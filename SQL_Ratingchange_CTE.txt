/*
This query is designed to compare the most recent and prior ratings and attributes of securities held in a specific portfolio  as of given date. It retrieves, for each security in that portfolio:

Current Data (March 2024):
	All relevant details for each security held in the portfolio as of March 2024, including asset ID, description, effective date, maturity date, coupon rate, and credit ratings from Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch, as well as the portfolio percentage.
Most Recent Prior Data (Before March 2024):
	For each of those same securities, the query also retrieves the most recent available record before March 2024, including the same set of details and ratings.
Combines and Orders Results:
	The results are combined so that, for each security, you see both the March 2024 data and the most recent prior data (if available), ordered by asset ID, security description, and effective date (most recent first).

Purpose
Change Analysis: This allows you to easily compare how the attributes or ratings of each security have changed from the previous reporting period to March 2024.
Audit/Reporting: Useful for portfolio managers, auditors, or analysts who need to track changes in holdings or credit quality over time.
