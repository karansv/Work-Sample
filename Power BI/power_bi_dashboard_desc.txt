I developed this Power BI dashboard to provide a clear and interactive overview of sales performance for Fashion Brand Chains. The dashboard compares total units sold and average unit prices across categories and buyers for the current and previous year, using bar charts, treemaps, and pie charts for easy visualization. It features dynamic filters for territory and store type, as well as interactive tools for exploring historical trends and sales targets. This dashboard enables quick, data-driven insights to support business decisions and performance tracking.
